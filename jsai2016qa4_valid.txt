 when a neural net solves for y-x-x , does it require learning how multiplication and polynomials work , or are multiplication and polynomials pre-trained via the structure of a neural network ? : machinelearning from a practical perspective , can a neural net solve for y-x2 without the use of sigmoid y-mx-b functions being [ pre-learned and ] used at some or all of nodes ? EOQ i have it that it just cuts off all parts of the big equation an ann is until there's mostly only x-x left . basically an ann is that : a huge equation that twists and bends itself until it's close enough to one that solves the problem .

 xeon vs NUM x ? : machinelearning you don't need the most powerful processor to do deep learning with NUM gpus , i've seen a single i7 work fine for NUM titan xs as long as you don't do a dramatic amount of cpu preprocessing of images . i will however say that having an excellent ssd is very important if your dataset doesn't fit in memory , a pci express ssd has NUM x the performance of a sata NUM ssd . EOQ i will have NUM gb of ram if i go with the NUM x or NUM gb of ram if i go with dual xeons . i will use one or two pcei-e ssds along with regular ssds for long term storage . i may do other work besides just neural nets , although that is the primarily reason for the build . there are other applications in machine learning that don't utilize gpus . i am wondering how much of a benefit would xeons be in those situtations . going the xeon route with ecc ram would cost me about $5k more , but i will have more ram so i can be lazier with my coding .

 iteration process of constructing a dnn : machinelearning while a bit of an oversimplification , the answer here is that these parameters are often learned . these parameters aren't learned via backprop ( as the network parameters are ) but are chosen using cross validation . check out this blog post for an intro . URL EOQ but cross validation depending on the size of the network can be too expensive , no? for example on imagenet , do they use cross validation to select the entire architecture ? i think it can be used to select between a few options , not many parameters like i cited . also i guess they began doing experiments with small networks .

 basic question about dimensionality reduction : machinelearning my thoughts are as such : fit the pca on train set . transform test set . fit the random forest using pca.train.set then apply random forest to pca.test.set you want to keep your test set as independent of your training set as possible . if you do a pca on the train-test set then the values in your training set will be affected by your values in the test set . seems like contamination . EOQ it depends on what you're trying to do . training pca on just the training data is the most accurate model of a real application and generally the way to go . if it's kaggle , training pca on the full data set is fine ( though may not get you much beyond only the training data ) . for many industry applications you may have NUM times more unlabeled data as labeled data and it may help to train pca on that larger set plus the training data . and like shaker82 says , pca isn't necessary for random forests unless they're taking too long to train and/or can't fit in memory .

 looking for a research buddy : machinelearning alternative is to start a blog and share your experience there EOQ the quality and number of unique responders on this thread is amazing . i think we can get a lot out of very-rapid online collaboration . i've written down my thoughts on what we can learn from polymath , and some other ideas : it would be a shame for us to split into pairs or triples . for each solved polymath problem there were NUM 's of contributors-since people aren't doing this full time , we're far more likely to finish projects as a really large group . it should obvious when a project is finished . luckily, we have many metrics to measure the performance of our models . for example , i might pose 'classify mnist by deep reinforcement learning' . proposals should be regulated in a decentralized way so we don't split our efforts too much-in fact until now polymath has only ever had NUM project at a time . potential consequences of this are our research scope being too narrow . i think NUM projects would be a nice compromise-it could instil some competitiveness in us . the proposals should have some element of novelty-people want to contribute to new things , not stuff that already exists . however, i do think some important projects could be replication of deepmind/facebook ai models whose source code isn't available . we could do this very quickly as a group . it should be as easy to contribute as making a comment on a thread . can anyone comment on what points they agree/disagree with ? i am thinking of hacking a quick website together .

 looking for a research buddy : machinelearning alternative is to start a blog and share your experience there EOQ you were right ! i was also amazed by the discussion . yeah polymath focusses on a single big problem at a time maybe it wont be right for ml as it has many branches and each problem is different in its approach . yeah proposals must be decentralized the thing is the project lead must have experience with publishing or handling large ml project so that that person can guide others in the right track . i am fine with more than NUM projects and nowadays ml is just too big . yeah projects can be of two types in my opinion where we implement unavailable models other aspect where embark on a completely big problem just to give an idea what happens when we stack billion layers to make very extreme deep net obviously there are lot of problems with such a problem which individually can be tackled in its own way . i think the best way is project being branched out and even if people work individually they can reconcile with others work and adapt their methods . also in my personal opinion subreddit for polyml doesn't work , maybe i am wrong but previously it happened that people forget the existence of subreddits so i think it would be great if someone sets up blog like thing such as here where it would be more organized and if an eminent personality is posting it will drive traffic ,make it more interesting and finally results will be out which is exactly the case in polymath where even field's medalists contribute . let me know your opinions !

 'no module named tensorflow' error when trying to run tensorflow : machinelearning the pip command you have in your path probably does not match the python command you have in your path . try pip show tensorflow to see where it is installed . to install a package to the matching version of python , either use the absolute path or do : python-m pip install /path/to/tensorflow-version-platform.whl also if you have different version of python installed on your system , i would recommend to avoid messing with pythonpath but instead learn to use virtualenv ( and optionally virtualenvwrapper on top ) to properly isolate once from the others . alternatively you can use conda and conda envs but do not mix the NUM kinds of environments . EOQ okay . since i already installed it using the pip command , should i uninstall that first and then install it using virtualenv ? or should i install the package with pip to the matching version of python ? what would you recommend ? or would it be best , since i already messed around , to uninstall python completely and reinstall using virtualenv ?

EOQ when you create a virtualenv , you isolate yourself from packages that are installed on the system python , so it does not matter to uninstall tensorflow at the toplevel . to install packages inside a virtualenv you also use pip , but the pip command from within the bin folder of that virtualenv . read the virtualenv documentation for details . anyway , before trying things at random try to understand what the problem is . have you checked where tensorflow was installed by your pip command with pip show tensorflow ? do you have several versions of python concurrently installed on your system ? which one is the one pointed to by the python command in your path ? you can try just to display the version : python-version to see the location where packages should be installed for this python command you can do : python-c from distutils.sysconfig import get.python.lib ; print(get.python.lib()) i suspect that your pip and python commands in your path are not aligned . you should use the pip version that matches you python command .

 k-means when some data is missing ? : machinelearning so you want to make k-means work with nans ? write yourself a custom distance function . depending on the nature of your nans , either ignore them ( if they're random ) or penalize them ( if two similar records are likely to have nans in the same columns ) . EOQ i would recommend /u/rasbt 's option ( c1 ) , but with the addition of a new binary feature representing whether the original feature was missing or not . in this sense , you're able to see if missingness is indicative of a new cluster .

EOQ there are many different approaches for dealing with missing values , some of them are a) if you have a lot of samples and relatively few have missing values in certain feature columns , one approach would be to remove these samples entirely b) if you have a relatively large number of feature columns and you can afford deleting some of those with missing values , delete the entire feature columns instead of the individual samples c) a maybe better way to deal with missing values could be some sort of imputation . the simplest imputation techniques may be : c NUM ) replace the missing values in a feature column by the feature column's mean value ( or mode ) c NUM ) replace the missing values in a feature column by the feature value mean ( or mode ) of its k nearest neighbors ( based on other features ) EOA

EOQ there is a whole lot of ways to go about this , not all of them good . the most simple way , if you have a lot of data and not a lot of missing values , is just deleting the datapoints where a value is missing . however, if this leads to deleting half your data , you might want to try some data imputation .

EOQ k-means is actually a special case of the more general em-algorithm for gaussian mixtures . k-means makes two assumptions : NUM ) each cluster is a multivariate gaussian with unit variances ; NUM ) on the e-step it maximizes over a subset of all distributions-over delta function ( that is deterministic assignments to clusters ) . the general form of the em-algorithm readily handles missing values .

EOQ ok , let's firstly understand how is em related to k-means . to use em you have to define the observed variables ( m x n matrix x , features of the examples ) , the hidden variables ( m x NUM vectorz , for each object it's the index of the cluster this object belongs to ) , the parameters ( k x n matrix w , centers of the clusters ) , and the probabilistic model ( you sample iid objects from a mixture of gaussians ) . now to do maximum likelihood training you maximize p(x | w) w.r.t. w . this is a hard optimization problem and em-algorithm suggests to approximately solve it by iteratively repeating two steps : e-step , where you find the closest distribution q(z) to the posterior p(z | x , w-) using the current estimate of w-. usually, it's the posterior itself : q(z)-p(z | x , w-). m-step , where you maximize w.r.t. w the expectation over q of log p(x , z | w) , that is w-argmax e.q log p(x , z | w) . in k-means on the e-step you are looking for the closest distribution q to the posterior among delta-functions , so you find the best assignment z-of each object to the current set of the clusters w-. since you are using delta-functions , on the m-step the expectation over q becomes just one particular value : e.q log p(x , z | w)-log p(x , z-| w) . now , if you want to handle missing values you just define corresponding variables to be hidden ( instead of observed ) . so on the e-step , you will find a distribution on the variables z and on the missing variables from x . the distribution on the missing values will probably be a gaussian mixture , and you will have to take the expectation on the m-step ( which is simple with gaussians ) . if this approach is something you would like to try , i can derive the final formulae for this k-means-em-algorithm with support of the missing values . but this comment is already way too big , so maybe it's the right time to start a blog :) EOA

EOQ hmm ... i do see friend for at least a few results ( granted they are in the middle of the list ) for companion . maybe i should think of a way to rank the find results by the actual euclidean distance whenever possible . sadly , it looks like competitions doesn't come up when you type in competitive . maybe i should look into using word lemmas or word stemming to look for common roots between words . i kinda have been avoiding doing this because i never personally find that useful .

EOQ excellent questions ! those choices are rather arbitrarily except the fact that i do want to control both of those parameters at some point . at first i started by using word2vec's vectors and i had a much better sense of what would be a good and acceptable radius for vectors . since i switched to glove and stopped taking the square root of the euclidean distance , i lost the sense of just what those parameters should be . but you're right , i am going to fine tune them in the near future . right now the radius2 of NUM is a bit too much since i often see unrelated words in the results .

EOQ that's a really good question . i guess we can be a little bit more robust to the actual word vector model if we use a proper distance function . in other words , using the cosine measure , you might assume that the length of all vectors is the same so it's good enough to just use the direction . this may or may not be true with glove ( i didn't check that the lengths are all the same ) . do you think i should switch to cosine similarity ?

 the openai research team will be doing an ama in /r/machinelearning on january NUM : machinelearning could the admin also mention the specific names of the team ? or we should assume all of the research members listed in the website will come to this ama ? EOQ the short version of my question is this-does openai have any plans to offer courses or other learning opportunities to people interested in the ml field who want to become well-versed in state-of-the-art methods and apply these in real-world situations for companies , governments, ngos and other organisations globally ? the much longer version of my question is this- as your website points out , and as will be familiar to everyone on this sub , progress in the machine learning field over the last NUM-5 years has been dramatic , and human-level performance has been achieved in tasks that many thought would prove extremely difficult . tools such as deep learning , lstm and others have provided broadly powerful techniques that , it is likely , can be applied to diverse problems and data-sets . i have read ( somewhere! ) that google now has hundreds of teams working to apply machine learning techniques to provide services within google's business . as we are all aware , google are not alone-and several major tech companies are moving rapidly to apply machine learning to their businesses . in order to acquire the talented people necessary for this effort , tech companies have basically strip-mined academia to acquire the best and brightest . in some respects , this is understandable , and no-one could criticise individuals for getting the best reward for their considerable skills . however, this means that academic programmes simply do not have the personnel or resources to expand and train a much larger corpus of people in this field . on-line courses exist , but arguably some of them are already out-of-date and do not reflect the important developments in the field . and simply taking an online course does not build the kind of credibility that companies need before allowing aspiring data scientists near their data . without a significant expansion in the teaching capacity of the ml field then it seems to me that what will happen is that large tech firms , banks and hedge funds will dominate and monopolise the market for people with skills in this field . instead of machine learning building value for everyone ( as you aspire to on your website ) the effect will be to entrench existing monopolies or oligopolies in the tech and finance spaces . the lack of teaching capacity as i have called it above will create a huge bottleneck and the value that could be created from applying these tools and methods to datasets and problems globally , in all kinds of sectors and countries-from governments to ngos to manufacturing companies , to insurance companies , etc. etc . will instead not be realised , and ( even worse! ) what value that is realised will concentrate in the hands of the already successful . geographically, the effect will be particularly extreme-us universities and corporations already dominate ml research and this situation is unlikely to change . if the everyone that openai intends to benefit includes the rest of the world then this is a real challenge . i realise that this isn't a research question , and that your response may be to say we are doing our best to create value for everyone by making our research open source . but, with the greatest of respect , this approach won't succeed . without people to apply the methods and techniques you develop , the benefits will not flow to companies and individuals globally . the state-of-the-art of the field may progress dramatically , even to human-level general intelligence , but the ability to apply these techniques will remain concentrated in very few companies . this will create dramatic winners and losers , rather than benefit for all . the key issue seems to me to be teaching capacity . how can we create the NUM s of machine learning experts ( per year ) the world could easily use and benefit from ? as a step towards this , openai could commit to hiring a group of top-level researchers in the field , who would be interested in creating a taught programme , with exams , with accreditation etc . to provide ml experts , familiar with the state-of-the-art in the field , but perhaps interested in applying it to real world problems and data-sets rather than advancing the field through novel research . i think openai , as a non-profit institution but one that's not constrained by the issues of academia , would be ideally placed to do this . and it would result in real progress in your objective to build value for everyone . thanks in advance for any thought you may have on this .

 stacked denoising autoencoders : cannot reproduce the filters : machinelearning thanks for the swift reply . agreed , this could be due to the smaller sample size . thanks for mentioning . as i did it , the ae is probably just overfitting on the noise pattern . so i put in a gaussiannoiselayer after the input . unfortunately, the filters dont look much different ( they contain more structure , but still nowhere near those edge detectors in the paper ) . a more fundamental question : what encoder/decoders to use ? from the paper i figured that they use some nonlinearity in the encoder ( probably sigmoid ) and the decoder is affine. also they talk about tying the weights of the encoder/decoder . i would understand this if encoder and decoder are the same class ( e.g. both sigmoids ) . why is it reasonable to tie the weights of a nonlinear activation function and a linear one ? doesn't this force the nonlinearity to state in the linear regime ? EOQ sigmoid encoder-linear decoder ( squared error loss ) or sigmoid encoder-sigmoid decoder ( cross-entropy loss ) are the two setups they use in the paper , they talk about this in section NUM . they talk about the use of tied weights on page NUM , but you should play with untied weights to check it out . if you can increase the sample size it should help , having an order of magnitude more information is useful for unsupervised stuff like this . also , another good source of info is the theano tutorials , here's the one for denoising autoencoders EOA

EOQ ok , i figured it out ! it is in fact the sample size : if i go up to NUM ( instead of NUM ) samples , i do get the kind of filters they report in the paper . i just didn't expect that the sample size changes the results/filters so drastically and sacrificed it for faster training . however, in hindsight it makes kind of of sense that NUM samples are probably not enough for a network with ~30000 parameters . thx for helping me out here !

EOQ someone correct me if i'm wrong but , denoising autoencoders ( dae ) are actually equivalent to gaussian rbms trained on score matching . i woudn't say that pre-training in general , or dbns , are outdated ; they are just different models , they are generative , while autoencoders typically aren't ( they can be thought ) . now , if you want a generative model , you can use either dbns or generative stochastic networks ( gsn )-the latter use auto-encoders to learn the probability density function of the data . why you should use one over the other , it's not that clear : for some problems dbns are better , for others autoencoders seem to do the job . i don't want to go off in a tangent but if anyone has a some details on why one should use one model over the other , i would appreciate it . as for the implementation , i was planning on coming up with one . if this still interests you i will let you know /u/ycyoon EOA

 gpu based training of crfs : machinelearning gpus are much more useful for batch operations ( e.g. convolutions ) than sequential operations thus it is hard to parallelize a crf on a gpu . take a linear chain crf as an example . the label at each timestep t is dependent on the label at t-1 . thus, for exact inference , you must perform your computations sequentially . chain crfs are similar to rnns so you might want to look at rnn implementations for reference . inference in an rnn is also sequential-hence why they tend to take longer to train than feedforward networks . you might be able to perform approximate inference efficiently on a gpu ? alternatively, you could also use a gpu to simply compute the unaries for your crf . edit : one last reference . if you're doing something like semantic segmentation you might want to look at the 'crf as rnn' paper from iccv16 : URL EOQ i've never heard of a library to do this , but like /u/colinscl said , if you're pretty clever , i think you might be able to get there , but i bet you're going to end up writing your own libraries .

 how do you determine whether you're overfitting when using random forest and other tree models ? : machinelearning tune your hyperparameters using your cross-val set ( NUM % ) , then use your test set ( NUM % ) to guess your error rate in the wild . EOQ i think in a sense you are both right . just the mere fact of having your training set accuracy be significantly lower than your validation set could likely imply the potential to trade training accuracy for a boost in generalization ( validation accuracy. ) so on the one hand , i do think overfitting only really occurs if there is a possible trade to occur there . but, usually there is by tuning parameters like maximum depth , regularization, etc . so in my experience , having a significantly lower training accuracy almost always means overfitting is happening , even if it's not the definition of overfitting .

 how do you determine whether you're overfitting when using random forest and other tree models ? : machinelearning tune your hyperparameters using your cross-val set ( NUM % ) , then use your test set ( NUM % ) to guess your error rate in the wild . EOQ i see overfitting as memorization . when using rf you have out-of-bag error rates ( training error rates ) . we should do cv , since it estimates how well our model will generalize to new data ( what we are most interested in ) . when you think you have too many features , i'd first try a simple sparse linear regression ( like logistic regression ) , and compare cv scores ( use a model to fit the data , don't fit the data to your pet algo ) . leakage may be a source of overfit . too many variables-rf usually causes underfit . it's actually pretty hard to overfit with rf's , since ensembling and bagging reduces overfit .

 how to apply machine learning to chemistry ? : machinelearning you may want to check out quantitative structure-activity relationships ( qsar ) . essentially , the properties of a chemical compound ( physical properties such as boiling/melting points , biological properties such as toxicity etc. ) are a function of its structure . your goal should be to collect a dataset ( depending on the complexity of the endpoint , already NUM compounds might do ) , and analyze it using typical ml methods . what do you think , how is the boiling point of normal chain alcohols ( methanol , ethanol, propanol , etc. ) related to the number of carbon atoms in the chain ? EOQ i don't know what's your context but i actually got to know machine learning when looking at chemistry journal papers . i am currently doing electro spinning . this is a process of making a certain polymer ( plastic ) by using a high voltage to generate plastic fibers nanometers wide. however this experiment is extremely difficult to carry out because many things can go wrong . you have to optimize NUM ) polymer concentration NUM ) surface tension NUM )voltage NUM ) distance NUM ) viscosity NUM ) temperature NUM )humidity there are about a few more that seems to escape my head but whatever it is it is a regression nightmare as all of them interact with each other(variables) when adjusted . there are some papers over the last NUM years that used ann and genetic algorithm to optimize this process . some journals said that the total possible combinations ranges to the millions and it's simply not possible to perform all of them . hence a computer is used to quicken the process . i'm not too sure what you can do in chemistry , perhaps synthetic chemistry may be of use ? i'm new to machine learning and i'm under the perception that machine learning is best used for optimization . hence you can find a place in chemistry that requires theoretical optimization that can be translated to real world experiments .

 finally have a k20 server to start deep learning prototyping and research ! but which framework to use ? : machinelearning why not mxnet ? URL it natively supports python/java/c-/julia/go and javascript if you want EOQ i'm in the process of switching from keras/theano to torch , so i'm gonna recommend torch . of them , keras is the easiest to use and get started in . but it can be a bit limiting because if the package author doesn't believe in something (e.g., restricted boltzmann machines , pre-training), keras won't be setup for it . one nice thing about keras is that it has really good support for multiple inputs and outputs . lasagne is basically keras-lite. its easier to extend then keras , but you have to learn more theano and you can't use tensorflow as a backend . ( the reason this matters is that a lot of the work in building a neural net is monitoring things like the size of updates , whether some neurons have become inactive , what's happening with weights and losses at different layers , etc., and tensorflow has visualization tools for all of that . its also a lot easier to extend than theano . but it won't work with a gpu on mac os x. ) torch is far more complete than any of the other libraries . it has more loss functions , more activations , etc. etc . a lot more . the fb extensions to torch , fbcnn, have the only properly-implemented embedding class of any of the frameworks . ( the others update every weight on every batch , which creates a lot of training problems if the data is sparse. ) fbcnn also has a working hierarchicalsoftmax class . ( actually , tensorflow has a whole softmax-loss framework that i haven't played with , that may offer hierarchical-softmax functionality , but it isn't made available through any frameworks. ) the downsides of torch are that its a pain in the butt to install and keep up-to-date , its implemented in lua ( for no discernible reason ) , and fbcnn won't currently install on mac os x .

EOQ regarding regularization , karpathy says : intuitively, it seems that higher regularization leads to smaller weights , which means that one must change the image more dramatically to change the score by some amount . so it seems that regularization makes the work of the attacker more difficult , but it is a quantitative difference , not a qualitative one ; the basic concept still applies . what is really surprising is that an adversarial example built for one network instance works also for another one . indeed it is not exactly like this , in the original paper they report a table in which is shown that adversarial example have more than noise probability to fool a second network , but they are far to work in NUM % of cases as in the network they have been built for . also another point that is not clarified is if the false target is the same for all the networks . suppose an adversarial example out of a banana picture is built to fool a specific network into seeing an apple , does the same adversarial example used on a different network fool it to seeing an apple too ? or perhaps another object ( different form a banana ) ? this is a sensible information imo , but i cannot find in the paper .

EOQ yes , an ensemble of nets is prone to adversarial example attacks . pretty amazing imo . URL intriguing properties of neural networks in addition , the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning : the same perturbation can cause a different network , that was trained on a different subset of the dataset , to misclassify the same input . for all the networks we studied ( mnist , quocnet [10 ] , alexnet [9]) , for each sample , we have always managed to generate very close , visually hard to distinguish , adversarial examples that are misclassified by the original network cross model generalization : a relatively large fraction of examples will be misclassified by networks trained from scratch with different hyper-parameters ( number of layers , regularization or initial weights ) . cross training-set generalization a relatively large fraction of examples will be misclassified by networks trained from scratch on a disjoint training set the above observations suggest that adversarial examples are somewhat universal and not just the results of overfitting to a particular model or to the specific selection of the training set .

 eli5: the reparameterization trick : machinelearning the trick part of the reparameterization trick is that you make the randomness an input to your model instead of something that happens inside it , which means you never need to differentiate with respect to sampling ( which you can't do ) . since the randomness is an input the whole network is deterministic , and you can differentiate the whole thing as normal . it is worth spending time understanding the aevb paper , the explanation there is very good if you take the time to unpack it . in particular , consider the following two ways of writing the objective in eq NUM ( where l-1 for simplicity ) : f(z) where z-g.phi(eps , x) and eps ~ p(eps) f(z) where z ~ p.phi(x) in the first version you can compute the gradient of f with respect to phi , because the sampling has been moved out of the way , but in the second version the sampling step blocks the gradient from z to phi . the second part of your question is trickier to answer because there are really two things going on in aevb that come together to make the setup make sense , it's not just a matter of applying the reparameterization trick . in aevb ( and all of its variants , including the papers you cite ) there are two forces acting on the sampling layer . one is the likelihood ( i.e. loss from the decoder p(x|z ) ) which tries to make the samples as deterministic as possible . the second is the kl term between the prior and the posterior ( i.e. encoder distribution ) , which tries to make the samples look like samples from the prior . competition between these two terms is what makes learning the variance of the distribution work , if you take away the kl term then the variance of the encoder will collapse . if you want to instead want to fix the variance and just learn the mean of the distribution then everything is dramatically simpler , and you don't need any of the variational machinery from aevb . in this setting you are just adding noise to the activations of your network and you deal with this in the backward pass by ignoring it . you can use the reparamterization trick to justify this ( which might be a good exercise to see if you understand why it works ) , but all the rest of the aevb machinery disappears .

 what is the technology stack behind a self driving car ? i keep hearing deep learning come up , can someone explain ? : machinelearning lol at the last line even though i wasn't specifically asking about google cars :p know where i can look for further reading ? EOQ there are lot of different challenges and pieces that come together to make self-driving cars work : perception, controls , path planning and different teams take different approaches to each of these , but perhaps i can give a somewhat dated overview . most self-driving cars use a mixture of lidar and cameras for their perception stack . some of the necessary perception tasks include obstacle detection , localization, multi-target tracking , and object detection/classification . for anyone of these heuristic-based or machine learning-based solutions may be applied . for instance for obstacle detection , you can get a lot of the way their by simply noticing what is significantly above the ground plane . a non deep learning stack for this would look like : obstacle detection via totem algorithm localization via slam algorithm multi-target tracking via kalman filters object-detection via sift and svm's deep learning could in theory be used to replace any of these setups and is definitely trending upwards . an impediment has been getting deep learning to work well with sparse NUM d pointclouds . ( some teams have taken the approach of migrating off of lidar , other have invested into research in this area ) . deep learning or deep reinforcement learning could also have uses in controls and path planning aspects of self-driving cars as well . admittedly my info may be a bit dated , but hopefully this is helpful .

 what is the technology stack behind a self driving car ? i keep hearing deep learning come up , can someone explain ? : machinelearning lol at the last line even though i wasn't specifically asking about google cars :p know where i can look for further reading ? EOQ i am not an expert on self-driving cars , so take this with a grain of salt : self-driving car is at heart a computer vision problem-computer must be able to recognize what it is seeing ( as in what's road , what's a sidewalk , what's a traffic light ) and then evaluate the situation . deep learning are complex neural networks ( witch a few tweaks ) that are very good at looking at an image and creating internal representations that make sense for the compute out of these images . in the end you need to be able for the computer to see road edges , other cars and road signs . i do not know how the other part works-translating the images understood by computer into action , but traffic is a set of formal and informal rules which then need to go into a prediction of what the car should do ( accelerate , brake, turn ) ... and is probably the easier part . these rules are probably a trained classification algorithm on some data from both a test track and perhaps even collected from real drivers . plugging a gps system that plans the route is compared to all this a trivial problem .

 what is the technology stack behind a self driving car ? i keep hearing deep learning come up , can someone explain ? : machinelearning lol at the last line even though i wasn't specifically asking about google cars :p know where i can look for further reading ? EOQ yeah you could definitely let it learn from the training set . as i've said i am not an expert on self driving cars , but the question is-if some rules are set in stone and you could easily translate them to some logical rules for a machine , why would you use an algorithm to learn them ? it would be inefficient . an example would be-computer vision identifies a traffic sign giving you the max speed . why wouldn't you let the car change speed based on the number it sees on a sign rather than letting it figure out it should slow down to that speed ?

 what is the technology stack behind a self driving car ? i keep hearing deep learning come up , can someone explain ? : machinelearning lol at the last line even though i wasn't specifically asking about google cars :p know where i can look for further reading ? EOQ maybe in that one case it would be simpler , but on a general case interactions are complex and hard to define in code , so it's easier to just record NUM s of humans driving by millions of traffic signs and their reactions . then a reinforcement learning algorithm will devise a policy that provably works best in all the situations recorded in the database instead of just dictating an abstract rule without considering all the other interferences that might appear . consider learning to react to a person walking into the road . how would you detect the person and its intent without machine learning ? it's very hard . a person has many possible forms . so we leave that to the neural nets . the same happens with driving strategies-they are much more complex in reality than on paper and we can't simply code them with if's and hand written rules .

EOQ but i am not arguing against ml being used to handle situations , i've said the following in my original post : these rules are probably a trained classification algorithm on some data from both a test track and perhaps even collected from real drivers . i have possibly forgotten i have written that :). my assumption was that the classifier used creates its internal representation of the rules based on the input variables which is the same as you are saying . you definitely wouldn't write the whole thing with if statements , we are far behind that paradigm . so i agree with you , i was just wondering whether there still aren't some ifs . a good example on combining ifs and ml algorithms is this one case where a guy had to predict when a bed becomes free in a hospital which can happen in NUM ways-a patient dies or gets well enough to leave the hospital . now, if you use patient inputs ( vital signs , etc. ) the algorithm might get confusing messages-some patient get better and leave while others get worse . if you would split the problem into NUM predictions-predicting people getting worse and predicting people getting better and then ensemble it , you might get a much better result as opposed to relying on a ml algorithm taking care of that split . i have also encountered something similar in a prediction problem i was solving at work recently where we were able to improve all relevant metrics , by doing an if clause that excludes part of the data from the prediction and marks them as negatives right away .

EOQ i saw a talk by google at mit and while they did not show any code ( that got a groan : ) there were many video examples of situations . the visualization was NUM d bounding boxes on a line drawing image of the upcoming intersection . so it was consolidating the gps and map database data with real time visual imaging and lidar laser ranging information . the speaker was specific that while they were doing daily builds of to improve the model there was no live ml occurring in the vehicles . lots of data from each days interaction used to improve the model and tests of the model but it was locked code in the car .

 question about reinforcement learning application in business : machinelearning lets assume it can be formulated as an rl problem . so, the agent is the brand , environment is the users on twitter ( following the brand ) . actions involve which tweet to pick from a pool of tweets ?. an important question to consider whether maximizing long term return ( sum of discounted rewards ) makes sense . one bad tweet could be potentially disastrous . it is also not clear why maximizing immediate rewards per tweet is a bad idea . in this case , you can learn features/context from tweets that produce high reward . this can be done in offline/online setting . also, if tweets are treated as independent , then there's no need for solving it using rl . even if they aren't , you can still dependencies without using rl . EOQ good point about the long-term return . i will have to think more about that . indeed maximizing immediate rewards can be critical for many brands . the long-term reward could be the total followers . but i don't know whether that will work here . i think the dependencies are important between tweets because that's how ( good ) social media marketing teams learn and decide on the content to share . when you said i can still model dependencies without rl , you meant using ml or more parametric models ? for example , i can use vector autoregression for this problem .

EOQ if your objective is to just predict the success of a tweet , then why not just regress the likes based on some deep/shallow features of tweet text ? i don't know much about rl , but what you are proposing could be of use of you want to lead a publicity campaign and learn optional campaigns or something like that .

EOQ well my objective is to see whether rl would be a good candidate to model this behavior . EOA

EOQ the central problem of rl is the exploration-exploitation tradeoff : when do i stop learning and start doing ? how do i maximize benefit given a resource budget ? to learn how to make good tweets , you need to experiment with many techniques . after some time , you can do some statistical hypothesis testing or supervised learning to estimate a model for making tweets . you may use that model for a while , but after some time you might wonder if the model is still valid . unfortunately , your latest data , after you started doing what the model indicated was best , is a biased sample not suitable for supervised learning . if you are nervous , you might start experimenting with other techniques again , techniques that your model suggests are non-optimal . now you're doing reinforcement learning .
